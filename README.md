# Barber 💇‍♂️💈

Welcome to the Barber App repository! This project is developed using Next.js 13, Prisma ORM, DeepAR and a MySQL database hosted on PlanetScale. It's designed to manage and facilitate operations for a barber shop, allowing you to handle appointments, customers, and last but not the least, tryon different hairstyles using AR!

## Features 🌟

- **DeepAR**: This project uses DeepAR's models, custom made by us, to give users a live example of how a certain hairstyle would look on them using their webcam.

- **Next.js 13**: The project is built using the latest version of Next.js, a popular React framework that provides server-side rendering and easy routing.

- **Prisma ORM**: Prisma is used as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool to interact with the MySQL database. It helps simplify database queries and management.

- **MySQL Database on PlanetScale**: The database used by the Barber App is hosted on PlanetScale, providing scalability and reliability.
